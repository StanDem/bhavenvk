caption=Report of employee №10 
report1=Monday\n\nThis is the first night on my new job and I'm happy about it. It's really hard to find a part time electrician job in our area. In addition, they promised me a great salary.
report2=Tuesday\n\nApparently there's someone else in this motel. If something goes wrong, I just turn off the lights and sit quietly looking at the window. I'm not sure, but I think these are... bears.
report3=Wednesday\n\nI was right! It is a whole teddy bear family! They don't really like guests. But I need to hold out for just one week to get paid.
report4=Thursday\n\nWhy are they just sitting in that strange room pretending that they can't move. I know they can. I almost died last night. There's a cemetery nearby. Maybe the fools who have worked here before me are buried there?
report5=Friday\n\nThis one is the worst of them. I call him Uncle. I'm sure I saw his pinned photo on the store's wall. He doesn't give me much time to think.
report6=Saturday\n\nThis is madness! But they're gonna pay me for this. At least they have promised... I should've carefully read that damn agreement. It's a weekend already, but I have to work.
report7=Sunday\n\nNO DATA
report8=Someday\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\n...Santa
